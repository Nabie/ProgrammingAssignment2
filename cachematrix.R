## This function create a special matrix and sets its properties.it sets and read 
## the value of the matrix and its inverse. it doesn't do computation.its aim
## is to store the differents values. Mainly it store the inverse of the matrix 
## and avoid to recompute if the matrix doesn't change

## x is supposed to be invertible. so it is square and determinant(x) is not zero

    ## it is renamed.

## This function make computation and store the result in the special matix
## Mainly it compute the inverse of the matrix if the matrix change and stored
## it in the special "matrix" otherwise
## it read it in the cache
